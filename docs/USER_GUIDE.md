## Understanding the Process

### Phase 1: Analyst Creation (5-10 seconds)

The AI analyzes your topic and creates 3 specialized analyst personas with:
- Unique names and roles
- Specific focus areas
- Different perspectives

**Example**:
- Topic: "Renewable Energy Future"
- Analysts: Environmental Scientist, Energy Policy Expert, Green Tech Engineer

### Phase 2: Research & Interviews (30-60 seconds)

Each analyst:
1. **Formulates Questions** - Based on their expertise
2. **Searches the Web** - Using Tavily search API
3. **Gathers Information** - From credible sources
4. **Conducts Interview** - With an AI expert
5. **Writes Section** - Compiling findings

**All analysts work simultaneously** (parallel processing).

### Phase 3: Report Compilation (10-20 seconds)

The system:
1. **Writes Introduction** - Sets context
2. **Consolidates Sections** - Merges analyst findings
3. **Writes Conclusion** - Summarizes insights
4. **Compiles Sources** - Lists all citations

### Phase 4: Export (1-2 seconds)

Reports are saved in two formats:
- **DOCX**: Editable Microsoft Word format
- **PDF**: Professional, print-ready format

Both files are stored in a folder named after your topic and timestamp.
